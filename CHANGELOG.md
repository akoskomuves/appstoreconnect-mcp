# appstoreconnect-mcp

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- a2108dd: Compact responses + auto-pagination across all read tools.

  Each list/get tool now returns a clean text table by default (`asc_list_apps`, `asc_list_subscription_groups`, `asc_list_subscriptions`, `asc_list_subscription_prices`, `asc_list_subscription_price_points`, `asc_list_territories`, `asc_get_app`). Every tool accepts `raw: true` to get the original JSON:API payload, and paginated tools accept `maxItems` (default 500–1000).

  Internal changes:

  - New `paginate()` helper follows `links.next`, merges and dedupes `included` resources across pages.
  - Sparse fieldsets (`fields[type]=…`) applied per tool to avoid pulling unused attributes.
  - `&limit=200` set on all list endpoints (was missing on `subscriptionPrices`, capping responses at 50/175 territories).
  - New `digest.ts` module with one digester per resource type, joining `data` ↔ `included` to surface the actually useful columns (territory + currency + amount instead of relationship URIs).

  Net effect: a full 175-territory subscription price schedule fits in ~5 KB of text instead of ~90 KB of nested JSON.

- cf4afca: Add `init` and `doctor` subcommands.

  `appstoreconnect-mcp init` is an interactive wizard that opens App Store Connect, copies the `.p8` to `~/.appstore/` with `chmod 600`, prompts for issuer/key IDs (Key ID auto-detected from the filename), verifies auth with a real ASC call, and registers the MCP in any installed clients (Claude Code, Claude Desktop, Cursor, Windsurf — auto-detected).

  `appstoreconnect-mcp doctor` is a read-only diagnostic — checks key directory permissions, parses each `.p8`, lists registered clients, and optionally hits the live API if env vars are set.

  The default no-arg invocation continues to start the MCP server over stdio (unchanged behavior for clients).

- b0794b6: Add `ppp_apply_proposal` — the single-tool entry point for a PPP rebalance.

  Computes the same proposal as `ppp_compute_proposal`, then asks the user to confirm via MCP elicitation (Claude Code, Claude Desktop, etc.), and on confirm POSTs all eligible price changes against App Store Connect in parallel. The user-facing flow collapses from "propose → review → manually trigger 14 writes → verify" into a single tool call with one in-client confirmation prompt.

  Built-in guardrails:

  - `maxDropPct` (default 90%) — refuses to apply if any single row drops more than this; guards against a bad Apple Music index entry crashing a price.
  - `maxConcurrency` (default 5) — parallel POSTs well under Apple's 50/min rate limit.
  - `preserveCurrentPrice: true` by default — existing subscribers are grandfathered.
  - `startDate` defaults to today + 7 days (Apple requires ≥24h; 7 is a safety buffer).
  - `confirm: true` arg as a fallback for clients that don't support elicitation, or for automation.

  Refactored `src/domains/ppp.ts` to share the proposal-computation logic between `ppp_compute_proposal` and `ppp_apply_proposal`. Added an in-domain `concurrentMap` helper covered by 5 new tests (37 total now passing).

- 3f0f600: Add `ppp_load_index` and `ppp_compute_proposal` tools.

  `ppp_compute_proposal` is the single entry point for a Purchasing Power Parity rebalance: it fetches the current price schedule for the target subscription, loads the bundled Apple Music Individual-plan price snapshot (`data/apple-music-prices.json`), computes a per-territory factor using Apple Music ratios as the implied PPP-FX rate, fetches valid price points in parallel for territories where the target differs from current, snaps to the nearest valid Apple price point (configurable `roundStrategy`: `nearest` / `down` / `up`), and returns a compact dry-run table with `POINT_ID`s ready to feed back into `asc_post_subscription_price`. Apply a configurable sanity floor (`floorFactor`, default 0.15) so bad index data can't crash the price.

  `ppp_load_index` returns the bundled snapshot as a sorted table (or raw JSON) so users can see what reference data is in play.

  The bundled snapshot covers ~70 territories with high-confidence Apple Music prices as of 2026-05-09; refresh upstream by editing `data/apple-music-prices.json` and resubmitting.

  Updated `examples/ppp-rebalance/SKILL.md` to drive the new tool. The skill now does discover → propose → review → apply → verify → rollback, with the gotchas (preserveCurrentPrice, Russia, USD-only territories, snap direction) called out.

### Patch Changes

- d4326ce: `init`: scan `~/.appstore`, `~/Downloads`, and `~/Desktop` for `.p8` files and present them as a select list (sorted most-recent-first, with auto-detected Key IDs). Falls back to manual path entry. Avoids the chore of typing a 60-character path.
